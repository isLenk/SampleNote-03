			<h2> General Questions </h2>

			<p class="questionHeader"> The Program Froze </p>
			<div class="questionDescription">
				There is nothing you can do about that, though you can write down what you did prior to the crash so it can be fixed in a later update.
				Unless the whole program froze, then you can just close the program, run the "Brute Close Excel Process.cmd" in the "Application Resources/Batch Shortcuts" folder, and relaunch the program
			</div>

			<p class="questionHeader"> Why does SampleNote require Administrator Priviledges </p>
			<div class="questionDescription">
				SampleNote writes to Excel files but also modifies files it created.
			</div>

			<p class="questionHeader"> Cannot write to Excel file, (read only) </p>
			<div class="questionDescription">
				Make sure SampleNote is closed before opening the file. If SampleNote is closed but the problem still occurs, that is due to an Excel process still active. <br>
				Run the Batch Shortcut named <font color="orange"> "Brute Close Excel Processes.cmd" </font> and reopen the file.
